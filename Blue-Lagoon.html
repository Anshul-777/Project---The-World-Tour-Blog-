        <p>Nestled amidst Iceland’s otherworldly lava fields, the <strong>Blue Lagoon</strong> is one of the world’s most iconic geothermal spas. Its steamy, milky-blue waters offer an unforgettable escape for both body and soul, drawing visitors from across the globe.</p>

        <h2>Origins and Formation</h2>
        <p>The Blue Lagoon was formed in the 1980s from the runoff of the nearby Svartsengi geothermal power plant. The water, rich in minerals like silica and sulfur, is replenished every 48 hours and maintains a soothing temperature of 37–40°C (98–104°F).</p>
        <p>Despite its man-made origins, the lagoon blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings, offering a surreal spa experience in a landscape that looks like another planet.</p>

        <h2>Healing Waters</h2>
        <p>The Blue Lagoon is renowned for its skin-healing properties. Many visitors come seeking relief from psoriasis and other skin conditions, thanks to the lagoon’s high silica content which forms a white mud used as a natural face mask on-site.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Floating in the Blue Lagoon felt like being wrapped in warmth and peace — a sanctuary hidden among Iceland’s fiery landscapes." – Wellness Traveler
        </blockquote>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Silica Mud Masks:</strong> Complimentary mineral-rich masks offered at the lagoon</li>
            <li><strong>In-Water Bar:</strong> Enjoy a refreshing drink without leaving the water</li>
            <li><strong>Sauna & Steam Caves:</strong> Relax with geothermal steam therapy</li>
            <li><strong>Luxury Spa Packages:</strong> Including massage treatments and private lagoons</li>
            <li><strong>Lava Restaurant:</strong> Fine dining with lava rock views</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Planning Your Visit</h2>
        <p>Located just 20 minutes from Keflavík International Airport and 45 minutes from Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon is an easy addition to any Iceland itinerary. Advance booking is required due to high demand.</p>
        <p>The best time to visit is early morning or late evening, when crowds are lighter and the light over the lagoon is magical — especially during winter, when the Northern Lights may dance above.</p>

        <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>Walking barefoot across the wooden boardwalk into the steamy water felt like stepping into a dream. I smeared on the silica mask and leaned against the black lava rocks, watching the steam rise around me in the crisp Icelandic air.</p>
        <p>Whether it was the warmth, the minerals, or just the silence, I left the lagoon feeling lighter, clearer, and completely at peace. It’s a moment I’ll always treasure.</p>

        <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Book tickets in advance — they sell out fast</li>
            <li>Bring a swimsuit — or rent one on-site</li>
            <li>Keep your hair tied up — the minerals can dry it out</li>
            <li>Arrive early to enjoy quieter hours</li>
            <li>Combine with a Golden Circle or airport trip for convenience</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Blue Lagoon isn’t just a spa — it’s an experience of tranquility and transformation in one of Earth’s most breathtaking settings.</p>
